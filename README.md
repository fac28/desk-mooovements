# Introduction

What are you building?

- We are building an app with a tailored database of places that suit digital nomads' needs.

Why are you building it?

- Digital nomads often struggle to find flexible workspaces without long memberships and those open at unconventional hours. This app will help simplify their search for a place to work.

# Project scope

We are not building an exhaustive list of places to work at...

Expect to find some hidden gems here, and please do contribute to the site with your favourite places to work!

# Project plan

Key components of the app:
- Viewing places
- Adding to wishlist
- Contributing (adding new places)

At the current stage you can see a few nice places handpicked by James

How are you going to structure your sprints?
What order are you going to build in?
How did user research inform your plan?

# Requirement analysis

We have a very intuitive design, and working on making the site accessible for all.

There's no legal or regulatory requirements that we are aware of.

# Did your team work effectively?

What would you do differently next time?

What did you find out from user testing?

# Project outcomes

Were your assumptions right or wrong?
Recommendations and conclusions

# What features would you prioritise to build next?

Was the project a success?
Software Development Lifecycle stages

# Planning

What roles did your team take on?
Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)

Did these roles help your team work effectively?

- Shaughn Scrum Facilitator, Yuqing UI/UX, Jame QA, Elena DevOps
- Within our organization scum facilitation means mostly leading stand ups and organizing planning the project was not strictly guided since we spent time planning together before the start
- UI/UX meant making sure the layout and way that you moved around the web site was handled in keeping with our intended user experience and prototype
- QA meant designing tests for the routes and key functions in our project
- Dev Ops was getting deployment to work and making sure all code would work on deployment

Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)

Analysis
What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?

Design
How did you plan a user experience?
What technical decisions did you make?
Server-render vs client-render vs both
Relational or non-relational or no DB
Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service
Frontend first vs DB first
Did you create a technical specification?
Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)

Implementation/Build
How did you ensure your code was good?
Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)

What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?
Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)

How did you debug issues that arose?
Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)

Test
How did you verify your project worked correctly?
Identify and create test scenarios which satisfy the project specification (S6)

Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?
- Ask James

Deploy
Where/how did you deploy your application?
- Ask Elena

What problems did you encounter during deployment?
- Fly didn't work;
- and we used Vercel because we built a NexJS app.
- 
Maintain

Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?
Our codes are nicely structured and easy to read. It's easy for someone to make changes to the codebase, and a new person can quickly be onboarded to contribute.

Establishes a logical thinking approach to areas of work which require valid reasoning and/or justified decision making (B2)
Describes how they have maintained a productive, professional and secure working environment throughout the project activity (B3)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you'll need a few environmental variables to run it locally.

Just ask us.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

Alternatively, view our deployed app here [on Vercel Platform](https://desk-mooovements-1b004ndx5-elenas-projects-f436e785.vercel.app/).
